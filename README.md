# ClassicalMechanics
This is a repository centered around learning classical mechanics (Physics)


# This Repository will use the Feynman Technique
The feynman technique is a learning model developed by Richard Feynman.

This means that every all content uploaded should follow below certain criteria:


## Title of the subject
The title should accurately describe the topic being studied

## Imagine / Analogy
This is a section that attempts to describe, in the simplest terms possible, the subject. This section should, if possible, refrain from using terminology that is not absolutely necessary for understanding the physical phenomenon. Its basically the explanation you would give to someone who has no background in the subject. Some things can become complicated, and therefore, may resort to using previous terminology in order to not make the description too wordy. I want to do my best to strike a balance between simplicity and practicality.

## Example
No point in doing this without clear cut examples to work through!
